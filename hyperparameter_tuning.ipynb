    "# Hyperparameter tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "* Two experimental hyperparamter optimizers were introduced\n",
    "  * `HalvingGridSearchCV`\n",
    "  * `HalvingRandomSearchCV`\n",
    "* Use a technique called successive halving\n",
    "  * Only a subset of data is trained on the parameter combinations\n",
    "  * Worst-performing candidates are filtered out by training them on a smaller subset of data\n",
    "  * After each iteration, training samples increase by some factor\n",
    "  * Number of candidates decreases by as much\n",
    "  * Faster evaluation time (up to 10x) than GridSearch or RandomizedSearch\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hyperparameter\n",
    "\n",
    "* A model's internal settings - set by user\n",
    "* Model cannot learn these from training data\n",
    "* Example: `learning_rate` in xgboost\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parameter Grid\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dictionary\n",
    "  * Keys - parameter names\n",
    "  * Values - list of possible hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "param_grid = {\n",
    "    \"max_depth\": [3, 4, 5, 7],\n",
    "    \"gamma\": [0, 0.25, 1],\n",
    "    \"scale_pos_weight\": [1, 3, 5]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Candidate\n",
    "\n",
    "* Single combination of all possible sets of hyperparameters in a parameter grid\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Resources or samples\n",
    "\n",
    "* One sample refers to a single row of training data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "* Any single round in which a single set of hyperparameters is used on the training data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### GridSearch\n",
    "\n",
    "* Exhaustive, brute-force estimator\n",
    "* All combinations of hyperparameters will be trained using cross-validation\n",
    "* If there are 100 possible candidates and you perform 5-fold CV; the model will undergo 500 iterations\n",
    "* This can be very slow for large datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### RandomizedSearch\n",
    "\n",
    "* Not all parameters are tried out\n",
    "* A fixed number of parameter settings `n_iter` is sampled from the specified distributions\n",
    "* Compared with Grid search:\n",
    "  * Shorter training time \n",
    "  * Optimal hyperparameters may not be found\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Successive Halving\n",
    "\n",
    "* HalvingGridSearch (HGS) is like a competition among all candidates\n",
    "  * First iteration, HGS trains all candidates on a small proportion of the training data\n",
    "  * Second iteration, best performing candidates are given more training samples to compete\n",
    "  * With each iteration, surviving candidates are given more training samples\n",
    "  * Process stops when a single set of best hyperparameters remain\n",
    "* Control speed of convergence by 2 arguments:\n",
    "  * `min_resources` - number of data samples to use in first iteration\n",
    "  * `factor` - next iteration, number of samples = factor * min_resources, number of candidates = candidates / factor\n",
    "* How do you set these parameters?\n",
    "  * If not careful, can end up with out enough data or too many candidates. Remaining candidates are trained on all data which is no better than GridSearch\n",
    "  * Set min_resources = 'exhaust' (is default value)\n",
    "  * Algorithm automatically determines best combination of min_resources with factor\n",
